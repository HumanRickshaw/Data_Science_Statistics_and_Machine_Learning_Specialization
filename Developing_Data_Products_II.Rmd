I have been traveling in Europe from early September through the end of November, 2019.  I have marked 10 of my favorite breweries during this trip, where for each brewery I had tried anywhere from two to five of their beers.

I averaged about one beer a day, sometimes two.  For the Brew Companies on my map, I often had their beer first at a bar, their brewery location, or a restaurant.  Sometimes I would find their beer in another bar, a bottle shop, or a grocery mart.  Sometimes I would find the beer at one of those locations in a neighboring country.
